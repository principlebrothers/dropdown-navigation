## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>The HTML code I'm proud of is using the <b>role</b> and <b>aria-labelledby</b> for accessibility</h1>

<div class="form__control" role="group" aria-labelledby="day-label"></div>
```

```css
/*I am proud of this css below*/
  input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
  input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  margin: 0;
  }

  input[type='number'] {
    -moz-appearance: textfield;
  }
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('The function organization and the implementation of Single Responsibility principle is what I am proud. ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Breaking the code into modules
- Implement DRY principle
- Implemnt KISS principle

### Useful resources
